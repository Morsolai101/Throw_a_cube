# Throw a cube!
It's a game where you have to guess the number that will come up when you throw a dice.
# How the number generator works
We generate a random number, then choose a picture of a dice with the number we need and display it on the screen, before asking Igarka what number he chooses.
## For example:
Guess a number between 1 and 6 or enter 'exit' to exit (Wins: 0, Losses: 0)
3
The roll of the dice...
```python
            "   _______   "
            "  | *     |  "
            "  |   *   |  "
            "  |     * |  "
            "   -------   "
```
You have lost 1 times. Fortune is on your side.
# How to improve the program
There are many methods how to improve the program this is one of them:
- Add some better method to find out if you won or lost  
- Add an interface to the program 
- Add the option to choose a dice
# Possible questions
| Question | Answer |
| ---- | ---- |
| Will I continue to develop the program | No. It was just a job to understand the nested functions.
| Can I use your code | Yes. I fully allow you to use my code as you like, except for works that were made on the basis of my code and are closed source. Also indicate the author |

# Note
I will be very happy if someone improves or uses my code. 

# Footnote
Please do not judge strictly. Python is still a new language for me, so I'm writing the code so crookedly.
